Contemporary Irish folk music, with a production that feels like it's straight out of the US (much like the album's namesake, Ephrata, Pennsylvania). Standout tracks include Tunnels, Pt. 2 for its grungy guitar-driven gnarl, Holllllogram's wandering and wistful folksy melodies and retro production, and 26th Street for a story-based arrangement, and ghostly and atmospheric string sections. Lyrically, think Johnny Flynn's timeless story-telling; magical yet modern fables of love, belonging and being, without cloying or self-indulgence. This album's title rings with the same frequency as the music: magical, other-worldly, yet strangely grounded.
