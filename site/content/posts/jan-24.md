First heard this in an artist/maker centre in Leeds. I made my friend Shazam it for me. It's the kind of thing that can be playing in the background and you'd never notice it, but if you're in the right mood for reflection, it hits you like a ton of bricks.

The guitar is consistent yet somehow always distinct. It feels like an ongoing story. It made me think of my Father, and the man I wish he had been. I wrote a song about it after listening.

I wore my headphones while working in the garden with her songs on repeat for a full day. It  continued on repeat for the next two days. It's a great passenger on a life journey.
